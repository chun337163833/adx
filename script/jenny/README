该工具使用jenny生成对数据库的操作模型类，便于开发

jenny.zip contains two jar files:

    jenny-dev.jar
    jenny-prod.jar

You will need to refer to both jar files in your classpath as you develop your
application and run Jenny.  But only jenny-prod.jar should be included with your
production code.

注意在cmd 下运行，如果connection refuse，设置mysql 中的my.cnf为0.0.0.0
